## Description

This RESTful API developed in node.js is a simpler version of a project I hat to develop during my fouth semester of my graduation in System Information at college.

It was developed as a request from the pharmaceutical company called Bayer. Basically what they wanted was a solution for the tallent aquisition department, they needed a new solution to identify new candidates that would fit the new opportunities inside the company.

We decided to create a new portal where employees can save new job positions and users can apply for those jobs
